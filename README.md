1. Synthetic Dataset: The source code for three models (Linear Regression, Linear SVM, and Kernel SVM) can be found within the "Synthetic" folder.
2. In some versions of scikit-learn, when running the benchmark method ActiveClean (code is from the authors at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r2vv252m5lnqpmm/AAAMj0WRaZX9EKH_8dLOHQpIa?dl=0&preview=activeclean_sklearn.py), you may encounter an error: `sklearn.utils._param_validation.InvalidParameterError: "The 'loss' parameter of SGDClassifier must be a string selected from {'modified_huber', 'perceptron', 'squared_error', 'log_loss', 'squared_hinge', 'squared_epsilon_insensitive', 'huber', 'epsilon_insensitive', 'hinge'}. Instead, 'log' was provided." This error arises from a recent change in scikit-learn's grammar. If you encounter this error, please replace all instances of "log" with "log_loss" in the SGDClassifier within the ActiveClean functions.
3. Real-World Dataset: This section includes three UCI datasets that were utilized in our paper. If you encounter the same error as described in point 2, kindly apply the  modifications to the ActiveClean functions.
